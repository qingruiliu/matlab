This demo fulfills the target of **trial raster plotting**:
1. post-cue period (1s) reset when licking;
2. early licks in the visual stimulation period are labeled as red dots;
3. hit licks (the first lick in RW without early lick in visual stimulation) are labeled as green dots;
4. licks in RW without water reward are labeled as blue dots;
5. licks in ITI are labeled as black dots.

The right axes plot the time length of individual trials.
